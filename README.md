# Hex Clock

The hex clock simply takes the current time values ( hours, minutes & seconds ) and combines the values as a hexa decimal color value which will be used as the background for the clock. As the time changes the colors respective to the hexa decimal value ( combined time value ) will always be changing in the background.
